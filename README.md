# WIP



6/11: tried to set up repo and push changes via Git. Had already done a bunch of stuff locally.

Existing functionalities that I can remember:
  
- Classes exist with collision check.
    
- Player exists with image, can move with arrow keys, speed increases when collision with coin, speed slowly increases by default.
    
- Coin exists with image, moves to left of screen, disappears when touching left side of screen, disappears when touched by player.
    
  - Coin gets created as a table initially and when respawning with function call createCoin(), spawns off screen on right randomly.
      
- Background image exists.
    
- Speed counter exists and is based on player speed.
