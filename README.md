# WIP



6/11: tried to set up repo and push changes via Git. Had already done a bunch of stuff locally.
  Existing functionalities that I can remember:
    classes exist with collision check
    player exists with image, can move with arrow keys, speed increases when collision with coin, speed slowly increases by default
    coin exists with image, moves to left of screen, disappears when touching left side of screen, disappears when touched by player
      coin gets created as a table initially and when respawning with function call createCoin(), spawns off screen on right randomly
    background image exists
    speed counter exists and is based on player speed
