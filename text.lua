textTitle = "A Day in Bill's Life"

textStory1 = "It's another refreshing new day in the \"Mushroom Kingdom\"! Unfortunately for you, you're just one of many \"Bullet Bills\" in \"Bowser's\" army! Your hopes and dreams of making it in Hollywood by playing various bullet-related roles in television and movies have been dashed by the soul-crushing reality that you live in a world where your existence is about as expendable as a used paper towel. Like your fellow brethren, you have been forced to take on the minimum wage job of taking down \"Mario\". To do so, you must collect coins to increase your speed. Make sure to avoid the \"Goombas\"! Your manager will dock you points in your next performance review if you aren't careful. Although you still cling on to the small sliver of hope that you might one day be able to play the role of Toon Bullet #4 in the remake of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", you take to the skies knowing that if you deal the final blow to the red-capped Italian plumber, your wife and three kids will have enough to eat for another four weeks, and your sacrifice will posthumously land you \"Employee of the Month\" in the \"Koopa Troop\"."

textStory2 = "But enough expository banter! Now we fly like bullets! And bills! And bills who act like bullets! For \"Bullet Bill\"...it is flying time!"
